        <p class="a">Overall, I've been pretty satisfied with my first quarter of university. It has definitely come with it's culture shocks, but that's expected. I am still acclimating to my new home for 4(maybe 3?) years, and I can't wait to see what's in store. Hopefully this is just the start to a fufilling and productive year. Go Dawgs! This is a paragraph in normal font.</p>
